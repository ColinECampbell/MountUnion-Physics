# MountUnion-Physics
Interactive Programming Labs for courses at the University of Mount Union. 

Note that running via mybinder.org results in some slow animations. On mybinder.org you also need to disable tex (comment out `plt.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True`) and use `%matplotlib widget` to run the simulations; mybinder.org may be abandoned if a convenient speedup workaround can't be found.
